# 👋 Hi, I'm Lau!

I have always loved creating things, drawing, painting, sculpting —you name it. 
As a child, I imagined wonderful worlds made of cardboard and lots of glue, where my favorite characters lived the craziest adventures. Today, I study computer science at the <a href="https://www.utc.fr/">Université de Technologie de Compiègne</a> in France, and I am passionate about video game design.
By the way, feel free to check out my projects.
